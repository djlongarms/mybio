Hello!

My name is Nicholas Palmer, but feel free to call me Nick! I'm here to expand on some already existent coding skills I've been learning over most of my life, and formalize the knowledge I have so I can show prospective employers what exactly I can do with my coding knowledge. In my free time I enjoy reading high fantasy novels, playing all different kinds of video games, and taking long walks around my apartment!

I look forward to getting to know everyone, and learning all that we can together!
